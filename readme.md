# LMS - SEARCH/QUERY MODULE

This app uses the handy tool JSON server to fake a REST API. So 2 steps are involved to get this app running.

1. Install JSON Server. 

First you must install npm files for the fake REST API - located in folder server. db.json is our database

2. Install npm packages for the app as normal

Thanks for looking.
